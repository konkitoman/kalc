Is a simple calculator!
I can be used where we have an number input for an user and the user can put a formula,
but the app only gets a i64 or a f64 and if has a error you can display an error at the user,
but errors are english only!

Only supports:

- Addition +
- Substraction -
- Multiplication *
- Division /
- Sin sin()
- Cos cos()

And groups like: 2 * (2 - 1) = 2
And 2 (3) = 6
And sin(1) = 0.8414709848078965

But +,-,*,/ are not in the math order for now!
